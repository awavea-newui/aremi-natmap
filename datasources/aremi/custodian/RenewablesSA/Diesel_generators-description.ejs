The South Australian Diesel Generation Database (Database) contains information on the ownership, use, location and configuration of electricity producing, diesel-fuelled generation plants in South Australia. The database was initially compiled in 2013 by IT Power Australia at the request of RenewablesSA with the intention of increasing the available information on diesel generation use in South Australia. A voluntary survey was carried out to obtain the information. Information provided on a confidential basis by private organisations was removed from the public version of the Database. Significant information was provided by the Government of South Australia through the Department of Planning Transport and Infrastructure through the Buildings Management section and through the Department for Manufacturing, Industry, Trade, Resources and Energy.
