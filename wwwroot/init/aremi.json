Data mapped is for the relevant critical peak season (summer or winter) at each Zone Substation. Where a constraint occurs in both seasons, the season with the largest capacity shortfall over the time horizon is mapped.</p><p>This map allows the user to see the progression of load growth relative to distribution zone substation capacity over time, and understand areas of emerging capacity-related constraint. Note that capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the zone substation and as such this map provides an indicative ‘slice’ of the capacity situation through one level of the network. Also note that these images show available capacity before network or non-network options are taken to alleviate constraints, and before load transfer capability between adjacent zones have been taken into account.</p><p>This map does NOT show:</p><ul><li>Areas facing power outage</li><li>The capacity of the network to accept the connection of embedded or distributed generators</li></ul><p>The green and yellow colours indicate a period when zones that have sufficient spare capacity (available capacity is around or above zero), while the orange and red colours (where available capacity is below zero) indicate periods where zones facing capacity-related constraints where investment will be needed to ensure reliability is maintained.</p><p>Polygons shown are approximate Zone Substation service regions. Clicking on a specific region will reveal the details of that location and time period, including the season of constraint and the exact available capacity value for each year.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution zone substation region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.</p><p>Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done. <strong>Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.</strong> Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels.</p><p>Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (&gt;$400/kVA/yr).</p><p>Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required.</p><p>From the investment year onwards the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

However, the peak demand of a network asset generally occurs only a few hours a year and hence it is useful to show the timing and magnitude of the constrained hours on the peak day.</p><p>This map layer shows the available capacity (as a % of asset capacity) for each hour of the peak day in the lowest level of the network each area with potentially deferrable investment. That is, if the zone substation has deferrable value then the zone exceedance situation is mapped, while if the only deferrable value is at the transmission level, the transmission exceedance situation is mapped.</p><p>A value &gt; 0% represents spare capacity, while a value &lt; 0% represents an exceedance.</p><p>Note that the critical season (summer or winter) and year of investment (2016-2025) is different for each constraint area. As such, the peak day data mapped for each area is for the planned investment year* and the relevant peak season. This means that winter peaking zones may be more likely to show exceedance early and late in the day, and summer peaking zones to show value during the middle of the day and afternoon.</p><p>In the additional information (when a polygon is clicked), the exact exceedance values are shown both in MVA and MWh.</p><p>* If the first year that support is required is after the investment year, then the exceedance for this year is mapped.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Asset name:</strong> Full name of the network asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Short name:</strong> Shorthand code used by network businesses to refer to the asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset type:</strong> Type of network asset according with the following definitions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transmission Line:</strong> High voltage power lines (including switching stations) built and operated by the transmission network service provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transmission Terminal Station:</strong> High voltage transformation substation built and operated by transmission network service provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sub transmission line:</strong> Subtransmission power line connecting transmission station and zone substation assets generally built and operated by distribution network service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sub transmission Substation:</strong> Transformation substation at the subtransmission voltage levels built and operated by transmission network service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Distribution Zone Substation:</strong> Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Network:</strong> Name of the Network Service Provider that manages the asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</p></li><li><p><strong>Proposed investment year:</strong> Financial year when the investment takes place. Where investment takes place over multiple years, this field shows the first year in which the investment takes place.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset capacity (MVA):</strong> Maximum capacity at which the NSP is comfortable operating the network asset over the coming 10-year period.

The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.nicta.com.au/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.nicta.com.au/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics.

WAsP is an industry standard microscale model that was developed for the creating of the European Wind Atlas (Troen and Petersen, 1989).<p>WAsP LIB files contain generalised climate wind statistics which are expressed as wind speed and wind direction frequency distributions for standard heights and surface roughness lengths. The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.nicta.com.au/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.nicta.com.au/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics.

WAsP is an industry standard microscale model that was developed for the creating of the European Wind Atlas (Troen and Petersen, 1989).<p>WAsP LIB files contain generalised climate wind statistics which are expressed as wind speed and wind direction frequency distributions for standard heights and surface roughness lengths. The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.nicta.com.au/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.nicta.com.au/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics. This was performed using the Danish Technical University (DTU) Generalized Wind Climate software package.

‘Breaking the Solar Gridlock’ – a research project developed by Institute of Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in collaboration with The Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets, University of New South Wales (UNSW) and The Australian Solar Thermal Energy Association (AUSTELA). Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"},{"name":"Updates","content":"No updates to the initial project data are available at this stage."},{"name":"Custodian","content":"Institute of Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney (UTS) worked in collaboration with The Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets, University of New South Wales (UNSW) and The Australian Solar Thermal Energy Association (AUSTELA).

As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>The SSHO data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly.

The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:<p><a href='https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/'>https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/</a><p>As part of the processing an intermediate more complete timeseries output is created, referred to as the Solar Station Historical Observation (SSHO) data, which is also available on AREMI. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>After the One Minute Solar data has been processed into the SSHO timeseries, further processing takes place to analyse the separate months of timeseries data to determine the &quot;most typical&quot; months. This analysis is based on the Sandia Method as detailed by S. Wilcox and W. Marion in <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf'>'Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets', NREL</a>.<p>In order to generate a TMY for a station it is a requirement that at least one of the calendar months has data from at least 9 different years.<p>The TMY data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data."},{"name":"Source Data","content":"The Bureau One Minute Solar data includes a range of solar statistics, including global, diffuse, direct and terrestrial irradiance and sunshine-seconds.<p>One Minute Solar data is not based on a real-time product.

The development of a new high quality observation system, which first became operational in 1993, has facilitated the measurement of one minute solar statistics.
