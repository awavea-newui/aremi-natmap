    <h1>About AREMI</h2>

      <p>AREMI is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data relevant to the Renewable Energy industry - with a focus on Developers, Financiers, and Policy Makers. It is funded by the <a href="http://arena.gov.au/"><strong><em>Australian Renewable Energy Agency</em></strong></a> and developed by CSIRO’s <strong><em>Data 61 team</em></strong> in partnership with the <a href="https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/"><strong><em>Clean Energy Council</em></strong></a> with hosting being provided by <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/"><strong><em>Geoscience Australia</em></strong></a>. This website is an extension of the Australian Government's <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/"><strong><em>NationalMap</em></strong></a> initiative.</p>

      <p><strong>AREMI</strong> is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically accessing the data directly from the government department or agency which is the custodian of that data.</p>

      <p>It’s a tool that’s aimed at connecting the dots for clean energy developers, who need high quality data on resources, infrastructure and existing technologies to develop new low-carbon energy projects. AREMI is making vital information available to clean energy developers now, with plans for more layers to be added in future. It is providing key information to the early stages of project development, allowing for an optimal energy supply solution to be identified.</p>

      <p>AREMI also serves as an extremely valuable tool for educating the general public about complex features of our national energy system, in a visual and easily manipulable format. The tool requires no special software, nor specialist knowledge. The make-up of Australia’s energy system has featured heavily in public discourse, and as such, tools to communicate to the public how this system works are vital.</p>

      <strong>AREMI...</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public</li>
        <li>facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies</li>
        <li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To see what data is available on AREMI, refer to the Data Catalogue in the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/"><strong><em>AREMI</em></strong></a> itself. Click the <strong>Add data</strong> button and expand the Data Set group names.</p>

      <h3>How to use AREMI</h3>

      <p>Just go to <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/"><strong><em>http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/</em></strong></a>. Most operations are obvious, but you can click the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/help.html"><strong><em>Help</em></strong></a> button for specific instructions.</p>

      <h3>AREMI Software</h3>

      <p>AREMI is an Open Source system available as a <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-natmap"><strong><em>Github project</em></strong></a>. The core software of this system was initially developed by Data61 (formerly known as NICTA) for the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/"><strong><em>NationalMap</em></strong></a>, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>

      <h3>Additional Open Source Software Used</h3>

      <p>In developing the NationalMap and AREMI, NICTA and subsequently Data61, has developed open source software and contributed it to the global geospatial community. NationalMap and AREMI leverage these excellent open source libraries:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs"><strong><em>TerriaJS</em></strong></a></li>

        <li><a href="http://cesiumjs.org/"><strong><em>Cesium</em></strong></a></li>

        <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/"><strong><em>Leaflet</em></strong></a></li>

        <li>The <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-natmap/blob/master/LICENSE.md"><strong><em>complete list</em></strong></a> is available with the <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-natmap"><strong><em>AREMI source code</em></strong></a></li>
