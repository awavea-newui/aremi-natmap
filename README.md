Australian Renewable Energy Mapping Infrastructure
==================================================

[AREMI](http://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables) is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data relevant to the Renewable Energy industry - with a focus on Developers, Financiers, and Policy Makers. It is funded by the [Australian Renewable Energy Agency](http://arena.gov.au/) and developed by [NICTA](http://www.nicta.com.au/) in partnership with the [Clean Energy Council](https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/) with hosting being provided by [Geoscience Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au/).

AREMI is powered by [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaJS), a free, open source geospatial catalog viewer.

### Want to make your own Terria Map? ###
Please don't clone **this** repo. Instead, start your map from https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap, which is maintained as a starting point for third-party maps, without the NationalMap branding.

See the [http://terria.io/Documentation/](TerriaMap documentation) for more detailed information about Terria and how to build and run it.
